I probably should be taking notes.
I started writing more things on paper.

Chunked Encoding meant I can't just read and send however many bytes I wanted. Very frustrating. I guess I'll send it in chunks.

I tried to do my own chunked encoding algorithm but it was too complex, simple is better here.

The secret is that you can rewind files with fseek. And since we know the content size we know exactly how much of the file to read.

I will follow this algorithm.
